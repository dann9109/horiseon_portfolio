## Description 
My motivation for this project is to fulfill my client's marekting needs by helping them generate more traffic through SEO strategies with semantic elements.

I built this for my client to help my client's search engine optimization features on their website by refactoring the codebase so that it follows accessibility standards.

I learned how important semantic elements are for a webpage's functionality and how important it is to improve the codebase for long-term sustainability.
